# AnalyzingVideoGameSales
Video games have been a staple in entertainment since the 1950s, beginning with early computer-based experiments like Tic-Tac-Toe (1952) and Nimrod (1951). The first video game created purely for entertainment, Tennis for Two (1958), paved the way for the video game industry. In 1972, the release of Pong helped popularize video gaming into mainstream activities. Over the decades, gaming evolved from simple arcade and console systems to home platforms like the Nintendo Entertainment System, PlayStation, and Xbox. Today, video games have found their way into arguably the most culturally and financially successful modality: mobile games. With its versatility as an entertainment medium, the video game industry is valued over $200 billion in the U.S. alone (Elad, 2025). Given its long-time success, trends in video game sales were chosen as the topic of interest given its versatility in data manipulation and machine learning.  

The dataset, video_game_sales.csv, was found on Kaggle during the data collection. The data was evaluated on its complexity, quantity of variables, and quality of data points. After finalizing the selection of the dataset, the variable na_sales – later renamed to North American Sales (in millions) - was chosen as the response variable. During the planning phase of this project, the sales metrics were assigned as target variables. 

The goal of the project is to predict North American Sales of video games based on the following metrics: Sales Rank, name, platform, year, genre, publisher. North American Sales was chosen as the response variable due to its relevance to current sales trends. Analyzing the fluctuations in video game sales trends based on factors such as who made it, who distributed it, and genre can shed insight on current fads amongst consumers and changes in the video game industry.  

## Model Development
Four models were chosen to analyze the dataset. North American Sales is the response variable for all four models. Meterics such as $R^2$, Mean Squared Error (MSE), cross validation, and confusion matrics are used to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of each model.
